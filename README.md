## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Features

- [x] View a list of posts
- [x] View a single post
- [x] Create a post
- [x] Upvote and downvote posts
- [x] Pagination of posts
- [x] Comment on posts
- [x] Nested comments (recursive lists)
- [x] User authentication

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - the URL of your Postgres database (eg. the Supabase connection string)
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - the Next Auth secret string (this can be anything at all like a password, but keep it secret!)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - the GitHub OAuth client ID (create yours in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - the GitHub OAuth client secret (create this in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site

## Potential future features

- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Sorting posts by recent (date posted), top (most upvotes), and most controversial (most upvotes _and_ downvotes)
- [ ] User karma scores
- [ ] User badges / trophies (awards for achievements like number of posts, years on the site, etc.)
- [ ] User settings (eg. number of posts per page, theme, etc.)
- [ ] Moderation tools / reporting or flagging objectionable comments for removable by admins
- [ ] Searching posts (possibly using simple SQL LIKE '%some search%', or [Postgres text search](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-a-search-engine-in-a-database))
- [ ] Subreddits (separate communities, that isn't just one big list of posts, that can be created by users)
- [ ] User notifications
- [ ] User private messaging
- [ ] User blocking
- [ ] User following
- [ ] User feed (posts from users you follow)
- [ ] User flair



For this assignment, I was able to meet several key requirements. I successfully implemented the core functionality of the Reddit-style upvote system, allowing users to upvote and downvote posts. Additionally, I ensured that the system updated dynamically without requiring a page refresh, which aligned with the project goals of creating an interactive user experience.

# Unmet Requirements or Goals:
One goal I wasnâ€™t fully able to achieve was optimizing the API response time. While the upvote system worked, there were moments when the UI took a little longer to reflect changes, especially under slower network conditions.

# Challenges and Difficulties:

The main challenge was balancing real-time updates with performance. I found it difficult to implement an efficient solution that minimized lag while ensuring accurate API synchronization. Managing state between the client-side and server-side was another tricky aspect, particularly when dealing with multiple votes at once. I plan to research more efficient state management techniques to overcome this in future iterations.
